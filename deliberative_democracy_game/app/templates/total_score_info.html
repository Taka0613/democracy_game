<h2>How the Total Score is Calculated</h2>
<p>The total score is calculated using a formula that takes into account the values for Environment, Economy, and
    Welfare. The score is determined as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Base Score:</strong> The sum of Environment, Economy, and Welfare metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Balance Bonus:</strong> An additional score is added if the metrics are balanced (i.e., the difference
        between the highest and lowest values is minimal).</li>
</ul>
<p>This ensures that both the overall impact and the balance between the different metrics contribute to the final total
    score.</p>
